# Variable Assignment
{: .d-inline-block }

Stable
{: .label .label-green }

There is no variable declaration in igloo. All variables must be given a value when they are declared. SImply put the name you want the variable to be, then an equals sign, then the value followed by a semi-colon. For example:

```
my_variable = 10;
```

A variable name cannot start with a number, but after it can.
